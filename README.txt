All the code that I wrote is in a .ipynb file. This can be run on google colab. Under the Runtime tab click run all. When first cell is run, it will prompt you 
to choose a dataset, where you should choose the "clean_adult.csv" provided to us for this assignment. The rest of the cells should run on their own. Some
cells may take longer than others.


The code for this assignment was mostly written by me with a little bit of guidance from sites like Analytics Vidhya and Scikit-learn.

I have given credit to code that I took from these websites on the google colab file.
